# Frontend Mentor - Shortly URL shortening API Challenge solution

This project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of React, especially functional components and hooks. The goal was to build a responsive landing page that uses the Clean URI API to shorten URLs, display results, and manage state persistently.


## Overview
This project involved building a URL shortening tool using React functional components and hooks. The main focus was on managing user input, communicating with an external API, handling persistent state, and providing a seamless user experience.

### The challenge
Managing state updates after async API calls required ensuring that urls was correctly updated and synchronized with localStorage.Handling navigator.clipboard permissions and fallback was simple in modern browsers, but needs attention for wider compatibility.Keeping the UI responsive and accessible while managing asynchronous updates.

## My process
This project gave me hands-on experience working with React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for state management and side effects. Integrating the Bitly API to shorten URLs taught me how to work with asynchronous API calls and handle authentication using tokens securely.Managing local storage to persist shortened URLs was an important learning point, as it improved my understanding of how to maintain state between page reloads and create a better user experience.
I also implemented the Clipboard API for copying links, which enhanced the app’s usability and gave me a chance to work with modern web APIs.
Some challenges I faced included handling API errors gracefully and ensuring valid user input. For future improvements, I want to add more comprehensive validation, user feedback during loading states, and potentially integrate more advanced state management techniques.
Overall, this challenge helped me build confidence in React development and API integration while sharpening my problem-solving skills.
